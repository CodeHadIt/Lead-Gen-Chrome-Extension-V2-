/*This works only on Chrome Web Browsers*/

- To get started, you first need to download the Zip file from Github. Incase you're seeing this outside GitHub, dowload it from my Github repo here /*https://github.com/CodeHadIt*/

- After download, simply go to your extension manager on your chrome browser and turn on developer mode.

- On the top left and corder, you'll see the upload tab, click on it and selected the downloaded Zip folder. Voila!, you can now start scrapping leads!!!

- You can either copy and paste links manually(Sucks I know! but some bozos still dip bread in tea so...).

- Alternatively, you can go the Chad route and use the save Tab button to pluck the url from the address bar on any website you're on.

- Happy scrapping!!!
